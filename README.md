Well, this project was about a help for me to study Design Patterns from the book "O Reilly's Head First Design Patterns" 
but I wanted to translate the examples from java to php because I like more this language and it was an interesting practice for me.
Polymorphism in php is very differente than in java. That was a challenge.
And as I was translating to php it, was a great practice to remember the principles of OO programming.
